### Study Materials
Additional Materials from the Textbook

The textbook for this course is: Strang, Gilbert. Introduction to Linear Algebra. 4th ed. Wellesley-Cambridge Press, 2009. ISBN: 9780980232714.

The Table of Contents, Preface, and selected chapters are freely available online.

There is newer edition of the book: Strang, Gilbert. Introduction to Linear Algebra. 5th ed. Wellesley-Cambridge Press, 2016. ISBN: 9780980232776.

NOTE: More material on linear algebra (and much more about differential equations) is in Professor Strang’s 2014 textbook Differential Equations 

and Linear Algebra. In 2016, the textbook was developed into a series of 55 short videos, Learn Differential Equations: Up Close with Gilbert Strang and Cleve Moler.

Previous Years’ Problem Sets and Exams

Problem sets, quizzes, and exams from previous years are also available.



### Readings
The readings are assigned in: Strang, Gilbert. Introduction to Linear Algebra. 4th ed. Wellesley-Cambridge Press, 2009. ISBN: 9780980232714.

Reading assignments are also provided for the newer edition: Strang, Gilbert. Introduction to Linear Algebra. 5th ed. Wellesley-Cambridge Press, 2016. ISBN: 9780980232776.
